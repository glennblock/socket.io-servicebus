# socket.io-servicebus - socket.io store using Windows Azure Service Bus

This project provides a Node.js package that lets you use Windows Azure Service Bus as a back-end communications
channel for socket.io applications.

# Library Features

* Service Bus Store
    * Easily connect multiple socket.io server instances over Service Bus
    * Non-invasive, just a few lines of code.

# Getting Started
## Download Source Code

To get the source code of the SDK via **git** just type:

    git clone https://github.com/WindowsAzure/socket.io-servicebus
    cd ./socket.io-servicebus

## Install the npm package

You can install the azure npm package directly.

    npm install socket.io-servicebus

# Usage

First, set up your Service Bus namespace. Create a topic to use for communications, and one subscription per socket.io server instance.
These can be created either via the Windows Azure portal or programmatically using the Windows Azure SDK for Node.

Then, configure socket.io to use the Service Bus Store:

```Javascript
var sio = require('socket.io');
var SbStore = require('socket.io-servicebus');

var io = sio.listen(server);
io.configure(function () {
  io.set('store', new SbStore({
    topic: topicName,
    subscription: subscriptionName,
    connectionString: connectionString
  }));
});
```

The connection string can either be retrieved from the portal, or using our powershell / x-plat CLI tools. From here, communications to and from the server will get routed over Service Bus.

## Current Issues

The current version (0.0.1) only routes messages; client connection state is stored in memory in the server instance. Clients need to consistently connect to the same server instance to avoid losing their session state.
